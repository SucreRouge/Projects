Line-Following Car built for the finals of 'Ambitions', a competition organized by The Hong Kong Institute of Engineers. The Car uses two infrared sensors at the front to detect the line and two servo motors attached to a motor controller board for autonomous control.

### [Rube_Goldberg](https://github.com/krohak/Projects/blob/master/Arduino/Rube_Goldberg/Rube_Goldberg.ino)

The code for a Rube Goldberg machine built for the final project of my Intro to Electrical and Electronics Engineering course at The University of Hong Kong.

### [Ard_Calculator](https://github.com/krohak/Projects/blob/master/Arduino/Ard_Calculator/Ard_Calculator.ino)

A very basic Arduino sketch for a Calculator using DTMF as input and four 7-Segment LED displays as output.

Custom Batman Logo programmed on Arduino Uno. It creates custom characters using 8 byte arrays to display the design on the 20x4 LCD screen.

### [Snake](https://github.com/krohak/Projects/blob/master/Arduino/Snake/Snake.ino)

Arduino version of the classic game Snake.

### [Pong](https://github.com/krohak/Projects/blob/master/Arduino/Snake/Snake.ino)

**[Video](https://www.instagram.com/p/3gSbgblCcf/)**

Arduino version of the classic game 'Pong' using 16x2 LCD. Input from DTMF, a small buzzer in use for random 8-bit sound effects.


## Kinect

This is an experiment which combines the Depth Image captured from a Kinect Sensor with a Convolutional Neural Network, made for the purpose of recreating artistic styles of paintings.

### [Pen_kinect](https://github.com/krohak/Projects/blob/master/Kinect/Pen_kinect/Pen_kinect.pde)

Processing code for a simple application which detects the closest object in front of the Kinect Sensor and tracks the object, thus drawing a line on screen. The closer the object is, the thicker the line would be.


## Raspberry Pi
